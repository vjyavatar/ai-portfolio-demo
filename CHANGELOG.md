## r61.10 — Version stamping (this deploy)
- Single canonical version: **v4.61.10**
- 7-way stamping (endpoint + constant + window + console + meta + footer + cache-bust)
- CHANGELOG.md added
- No functional changes — just identification

## r61.9 — Deep DD report Aladdin shell (BUILT, DISABLED)
- Sidebar nav with 17 sections + scroll-spy
- Compact verdict strip (~80px instead of ~250px)
- 5-cell quick stats strip
- **DEFAULTS TO OFF** — enable in DevTools: `window._csDdShellEnabled = true`
- Reason for disabling: anchor-injection logic not validated against real data yet

## r61.8 — Aladdin DD entry page + stale-cache fallback
- Rebuilt the ticker-input screen (no more purple "What you get" box)
- 7-day stale cache: returns last-known-good data when Yahoo rate-limits
- Inline error states (RETRY button next to input)
- Recent-tickers tracking via localStorage

## r61.7 — Multi-factor Bottom Line + complete layman coverage
- Bottom Line composite score across 10 weighted factors (was 4)
- Factor breakdown table (Quality, Value, Sector momentum, Earnings execution, Risk-adj returns, Drawdown risk, Insider signal, Inst confidence, Peer leader, 1Y momentum)
- Layman blocks added to 4 missing sections (Thesis, Financial Health, Sector Context, SWOT)
- Earnings Move Intelligence layman block (BUY_PREMIUM / SELL_PREMIUM / NEUTRAL explanation)
- MU now scores 37/100 HOLD instead of 100/100 STRONG BUY (honest synthesis)

## r61.6 — Combined Institutional Summary card
- Re-introduced gestalt narrative as a "🏛 INSTITUTIONAL SUMMARY" card
- Renders BEFORE the 5 individual sub-cards (insider/holders/risk-adj/peers/chart)
- Navy-bordered to distinguish from sub-cards
- Each sub-card keeps its own focused layman

## r61.5 — Earnings Intel friendly messages
- "Missing 4 key fields: earnings_history, next_earnings_date, post_earnings_moves, implied_move_inputs" → "No upcoming earnings catalyst on the calendar..."
- Context-aware messages based on what's missing
- Technical field list still preserved in `_missing_technical` for debugging

## r61.4 — Split institutional layman + enriched all laymen
- Separate sub-laymen: insider_activity, institutional_holders, risk_adjusted, peer_table, price_chart
- Each sub-card describes only its own data (no cross-bleed)
- Enriched with specific numbers: Sharpe 1.46, 82% inst ownership, -$3.50M net flow

## r61.3 — Three critical bug fixes
- **Insider $ values**: parse from transactions even when summary path provides counts (no more fake $0.00M)
- **Bottom Line score field**: read `thesis["investability_score"]` not `thesis["score"]` (fixes 0/100 AVOID vs 100/100 STRONG BUY mismatch)
- **30-min DD cache** + 7-day stale cache infrastructure

## r61.2 — Insider Activity NEUTRAL 0/0 fix
- Two-strategy fetch: `insider_purchases` summary + `insider_transactions` fallback
- Robust column detection (Shares vs Shares Traded, Position vs Relation, etc.)
- Honest INCOMPLETE state instead of fake NEUTRAL with all zeros

## r61.1 — Layman blocks + Bottom Line synthesis
- Backend layman generation for all sections (PLAIN + NOTE)
- Bottom Line synthesis card at top: verdict, headline, watch, concerns, ideal_for
- Frontend hooks for 6 sections initially (extended to 16 in r61.7)

## r61.0 — Design system foundation
- `static/celesys-ds.css` (568 lines) — Aladdin-style tokens, components, layout primitives
- `/ds-preview` route serving design system mockup
- Light theme + navy + medium density confirmed
- Zero production screen changes

---

## r60.x — Institutional sections + scoring fixes

### r60.4 — 6 NEW Deep DD institutional sections
- Earnings Move Intelligence (mirrored into DD from Active Trading)
- Insider Activity (US: yfinance Form 4; India: NSE promoter %)
- Institutional Ownership (US: top 10 13F; India: DII/FII split)
- Peer Comparison Table (subject vs peers, ★ on best metrics)
- 1-Year Price Chart (SVG sparkline + return %)
- Risk-Adjusted Returns (Sharpe + Max DD + Vol with grades)
- Active Trading Earnings panel moved from position 8 → position 2 in scroll

### r60.3 — Deep DD India fallback + 4 institutional sections
- NSE + Google Finance fallback wired into DD endpoint
- Catalysts (next earnings + analyst targets + short interest + dividend)
- Valuation Detail (DCF intrinsic value)
- Quarterly Earnings History (8-Q beat/miss)
- Risk Matrix v2 (passed checks)

### r60.2 — Earnings Move Intelligence + Universe Filter wired
- `earnings_intel.py` module (BUY_PREMIUM / SELL_PREMIUM / NEUTRAL / INCOMPLETE)
- `data_sources.py` (region-aware fallback layer)
- Universe filter wired into Active Trading scanner

### r60.1 — Universe Filter Bar UI
- Universe pills in Active Trading (ALL / LARGE / MID / SMALL / MICRO / ETF) with live counts

### r60.0 — Porter Five Forces fix + Universe Classifier
- Porter formula fixed: `max(0, min(50, round(50 - avg*5, 1)))` (was outputting 25-70 with "/50" display)
- `universe_classifier.py` with 755 tickers (IN: 366, US: 389)
- 3 routes: `/api/universe`, `/api/universe-classify`, `/api/universe-stats`

## How to verify which version is deployed

After every push, run any ONE of these:

```bash
# From terminal:
curl https://celesys.ai/api/version

# From browser DevTools console:
window.CELESYS_VERSION

# Look at bottom-right of any page:
# Tiny "v4.61.10" stamp visible
```

If you see the OLD version after deploying, your browser is caching the old JS. Hard-refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac).
